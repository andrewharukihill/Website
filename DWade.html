			Most of the time, speed is simply how long it takes to get from point A to point B. That’s the classical Speed = Distance / Time, which can be gussied up into those ‘A train leaving Pittsburgh at 60 mph heads toward Cleveland, which is approx. 140 miles away. Another train leaving from Cleveland, etc. etc.’ problems. But in basketball it’s not as simple. Sometimes how fast you seem to be moving is actually determined by how slow you can be.

			Dwyane Wade is known by a few monikers that range from concise and lacking art (the simple ‘D-Wade’) to creatively-constipated and lacking meaning (WOW [Way Of Wade]<a id='footer-link' href='DWade.html#footer'><sup>1</sup></a>). Somewhere in between is the evocative ‘Flash’, which is a clear call-back to the DC Comics superhero the Flash. Their nominal bond is even stronger when you consider how their speed is illustrated by their respective frames of reference. Put simply, the Flash’s speed is shown by slowing everyone and everything else. Wade’s speed is created by slowing all of his movements and quickly accelerating out of his usual viscous pace.

			At no. 10: After the turnover, Wade languidly initiates the break, during which he loses a man advantage due to his pace. In response, the Wally Szczerbiak and his leaden feet attempt to draw a charge at half court by idling towards the sideline. But in a fit of inspiration, Wade whips the ball around him and, as if he didn’t just catch Wally with his pants around his ankles, ambles down the court without breaking stride. The dramatic sequence is punctuated by a thunderous alley-oop to Shaquille O’Neal whose celebration is somehow more vital than Wade’s previous antics.

			It could then be argued that the next couple of plays are a result of Wade’s preternatural ability to bend space and time with his quick accelerations. A quick cross-over here and a rangy euro-step there create stages for impossible trick shots.

			<p class='article-text', id='5-par-6'>
			On no. 7, like a panther waiting to strike its prey, Wade eyes the pocket pass to a rolling Amar’e Stoudemire. After a quick succession of timing steps akin to a tennis player locating a coming ball in his sweet spot, Wade pounces and, to carry the tennis analogy one-step further, fucking destroys Stoudemire’s flaccid push shot with a overhead smash. He recovers the somehow-still-full-of-air ball and casually lets fly a three-quarter court shot that, of course, finds net like a pebble being dropped in a bucket. Even his celebration, a mix of gyrating hips and schoolgirl skipping, is a testament towards his pace.<a id='footer-link' href='DWade.html#footer'><sup>3</sup></a>

			No. 6 doesn’t advance my argument so I’ll skip it.

			But no. 5! No. 5 has Wade jogging the ball up before receiving a double screen in semi-transition. In anticipation of the ball-defender getting blasted by the picks, one defender shows at just above the level of the screen in an effort to defang the pick and roll attack by forcing Wade to the sideline or at least away from the basket. Wade’s pace remains unchanged as he navigates around the screens until he pounds the ball with noticeably more force and pushes a quick crossover to split the defense. Emeka Okafor, who is guarding one of the screeners, is supposed to play free safety in case Wade passes out of the action and also be the last line of defense if the defense breaks down. Okafor understandably doesn’t anticipate the split and definitely doesn’t anticipate getting put on a poster as he tries to recover on the drive. 
		</p>

			<p class='article-text', id='5-par-9'>
			So far we’ve seen Wade’s two-dimensional, horizontal acceleration. Here however, he adds the z-axis as he explodes into Okafor’s reach and makes him consider a career change.
		</p>

			<p class='article-text', id='5-par-10'>
 			In no. 4, Wade introduces angular acceleration to the equation as he eschews a normal layup for a corkscrew floater that honestly may have had no functional value, but looked pretty cool. On the third angle in video, the defender’s body blocks the camera’s view of most of the spin and tricks the eye into believing that Wade didn’t just 360° on him. That quick shot illustrates just how fast he was spinning and how much body control and presence of mind he has to cleanly lay the ball up off the glass and in.
 		</p>

 			<p class='article-text', id='5-par-11'>
			No. 3 takes the main principles of no. 5 and 4 to a thunderous two-handed slam on Kendrick Perkins, who probably gets asked about this play more than anything else in his career. Wade’s spin on Ibaka, who, for a big, has exceptionally nimble feet, leaves him in the dust. Wade then transfers the angular momentum of the spin into a purely linear and vertical leap. After the initial spin, most players would have opted instead for an awkward reverse layup which could have been better defensed by Perkins. 
		</p>

			<p class='article-text', id='5-par-12'>
			Notice that the whole sequence was set up by a drowsy jab towards the center of the floor followed by an instantaneous cut towards the still-optimistic Ibaka and Perkins. Once again, Wade shows off his celebration chops with a classic two-armed cycle as he calmly bounds down the court.
		</p>

			<p class='article-text', id='5-par-13'>
			No. 2 is Wade using his apparent listlessness to full effect. As per tradition, he jogs down the court and is the point for a 3v3 break. But, contrary to what is drilled into every basketball player since they first stepped on the court, no one picks up the ball handler! It is easy and perhaps fallacious to play armchair psychologist through a Youtube video but I believe his sluggishness actually diffused the defense’s attention on him and instead placed it on the other streaking players. All of that attention of course moved to Anderson Varejao’s sore body and ego after he got yammed on another lightning-quick poster dunk.

			No. 1 is more of a quick shift in momentum in the game and the crowd than a corporeal one. It is a tied double-overtime game at Miami. The Miami faithful<a id='footer-link' href='DWade.html#footer'><sup>4</sup></a> is undoubtedly chewing on their collective nails as the Bulls have the final shot. The rationalization is that at best, the game goes to triple-overtime where the Bulls, who have an extra day’s rest, would have an advantage. And at worst, obviously they lose on a heart-wrenching game-winner. Wade, in an instant, flips the conventional thinking on its head by swooping in to steal the ball and hitting a 100% unpracticed running three-point shot as the clock expires. Apprehension quickly turns to joy and Wade stands atop the scorer’s table, above the outstretched arms of the raucous crowd.
